# save-life-android
A simple clicking game for android .. 

I created this game 2 years a go , It's a very simple game , In this game you try to save the life of a migrant bird through WW2 .

The bird trying to fly but the bombs coming from planes blocks his way , You need to avoid these bombs .
The bird has four hearts as health , Each bomb has it's own damage , some of them takes one heart , some of them takes three .

Now i'm going to add characters and abilities to the game . 

I work on the game in my free time .
